Man, I just watched The Amateur, and I seriously don't even know where to start! You ever have one of those movies that just kinda sits with you after it’s over, like you’re not quite sure what you just watched, but it sort of makes sense in a twisted way? Yeah, that’s this one. 

The plot, oh my god. I was half expecting the characters to start sewing shoes or something cause that's all my mind kept thinking about. I mean, did you see how they tried to solve everything with barely any plan? Wild. Kinda like watching me try to sketch a shoe design after three espressos, just all over the place but somehow works, you feel me?

> Anyway, I swear, I'm glad I decided to download the movie instead of watching something else. It gave me those vibes, you know? Like when you're flipping through fabric samples and suddenly the ugliest color becomes your favorite for a new shoe line. It was a ride, dude.

There was this scene that totally hit me out of nowhere, and I just sat there like, What just happened? Like, I'm still processing that plot twist. You know those? It's like trying to walk in a new prototype; you think you got it, then you trip over your own feet. Classic.

Speaking of processing, maybe I should stop trying to watch the movie so late, but you know how it is, keeping these creative juices flowing anytime they show up. Also, makes you appreciate all the late nights working on stuff when unexpected brilliance strikes like lightning and leaves you dazed.

char s = What am I doing here?;

Also, remember those colors I showed you at lunch? Totally inspired by the vibe of this movie. Guess it had some influence on me, after all. Seriously, you should watch The Amateur if you haven't. It's like the kind of chaos I thrive on, somehow makes sense in its weird way, you know?
